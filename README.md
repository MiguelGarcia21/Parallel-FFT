# Parallel-FFT
FFT is a critical algorithm in signal processing and many scientific applications. The goal is to parallelize the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to handle large datasets more efficiently.
The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool used to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. It breaks down a signal into its constituent frequencies, allowing us to analyze the frequency components present in the signal.
This transformation is useful in many areas, such as signal processing, image processing, and data analysis. However, computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) directly for large datasets can be computationally expensive, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the input. 
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm that computes the DFT with a significantly reduced time complexity of O(n log n). 
An easy way to understand the purpose of the algorithm is the following:
Imagine we have a large group of people, and we need
In parallel programming, the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm can be parallelized by distributing the independent computations across multiple threads. This can further improve the performance, especially for very large datasets, by taking advantage of multi-core and parallel computing architectures.
